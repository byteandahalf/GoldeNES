An emulator for the 2A03 processor(the NES variant of the 6502) from 1980, written in C++.
I am making this project solely for the purpose of learning how the 6502 processor works, as
well as emulators in general. This will probably never be perfect since I am not very smart.
This project has taken some inspiration from [tkieft's nes emulator](https://github.com/tkieft/nes-emulator),
but I have not copy/pasted any of the code, I simply refer to his code as an already working
example to compare to my code. This project uses the [SFML library](http://www.sfml-dev.org/). Do whatever you want with this code, I don't really care.

## Building

This project requires the [SFML library](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) to build. See [SFML's Visual Studio tutorial](http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.3/start-vc.php)
or [their Code::Blocks tutorial](http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.3/start-cb.php) to learn how to install the library and run this program.
Yeah, that's it. Not a very helpful README, is it?
